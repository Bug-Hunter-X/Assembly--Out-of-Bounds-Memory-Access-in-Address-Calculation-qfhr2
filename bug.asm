mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 8]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx*4 + 8`.  However, if the value of `ecx` is unexpectedly large, the resulting address may fall outside the bounds of allocated memory. This could lead to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  The problem is exacerbated if `ebx` also holds an unexpected value, amplifying the address calculation error.

The error is subtle because it only manifests under specific circumstances (large `ecx`, incorrect `ebx`).  It might work fine with small test cases but crash during production with larger data sets.
